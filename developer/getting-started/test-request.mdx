On this doc we'll make a test request to the API by requesting the users list on our account.

## Request

```bash
GET https://api.hilos.io/api/account-member
Authorization: Token <your token>
```

if everything is ok, you'll get a response with an array of objects with your users' infomation as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "first_name": "string",
    "last_name": "string",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "id": 0,
    "teams": [
      {
        "id": 0,
        "name": "string",
        "assignment_strategy": "string"
      }
    ],
    "account": 0,
    "groups": [
      {
        "id": 0,
        "name": "string"
      }
    ],
    "profile_image": "http://example.com",
    "date_joined": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z"
  }
]
```
