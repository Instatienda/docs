## When to use this method

Use the Sending a Template method when you want to initiate a conversation with a specific user but do not expect/need to know when the user replies, or when you need to send a message after the 24-hour conversation window on your Inbox. This method is perfect for sending personalized messages, reminders, or follow-ups to individual users.

Sending a single message using Hilos is incredibly simple. Call the following endpoint, where {uuid} is the id of the desired template:

## Selecting and Using a Template

Approved templates can be found in Hilos Templates. Only APPROVED templates can be sent. If you receive a 404 error, the specified template may not exist or has not been approved yet.

Templates can be created using the Hilos [template builder](https://app.hilos.io/template).
Approval typically takes a few minutes, but it may take up to 2 days. Hilos syncs your WhatsApp templates every 5 minutes; you can also sync them manually from the same page.

:::warning
Please bear in mind that template approval process is managed by Facebook (Meta) and Hilos does not have any control over it.

## Sending a Single Message

Call the endpoint with the following HTTP POST request:

`HTTP POST` `https://api.hilos.io/api/channels/whatsapp/template/<uuid>/send`

```json
{
  "phone": "+525577664433",
  "variables": ["Alfonso", "John", "guide_es.pdf"]
}
```

Ensure the correct number of variables are provided, and the phone number is in E.164 format. The contact will be saved automatically and we'll ensure that if a contact with that phone number already exists, it doesn't end up duplicated.

Templates support as many variables as you need in the message body, and 1 variable for the header (for image, document, or video headers) and 1 variable in a URL type button.

To preview the template and determine the required variables, click the template name on the template list.

A successful response will include the message and conversation IDs:

```json
{
  "id": "a513da3a-8b73-42aa-a938-0eb1e0141533",
  "conversation": "ee49ab6c-dfd8-4cb6-a512-5880f4385622"
}
```
