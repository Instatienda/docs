This developer documentation will guide you through using the Flows API to manage and interact with your flow executions in the Hilos platform.

## When to use this method

Choose Flows when you want to send messages to multiple recipients and expect a response or interaction from them. Flows are similar to chatbots, allowing for dynamic, two-way communication. Use this method to engage your users in conversations, answer queries, or gather information.

## Create Flow Execution

Create a new flow execution.
