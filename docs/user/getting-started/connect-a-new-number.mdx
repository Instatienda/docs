In this guide we will connect your phone number to Hilos so you can start levelling up your company's WhatsApp. This will take roughly 15 minutes.

To follow along with this guide, go to [Hilos > Settings > WhatsApp Accounts > Start now > Connect your phone number](https://app.hilos.io/config/channel/cloud-api/create).

This is where we will be copy pasting information from Meta, in order to connect your number to Hilos.

Let's get started!

<Warning>
Before getting started with this guide check out our [Getting started](userdocs/getting-started/getting-started) guide to learn if Hilos is right for your needs.

You can't connect a number to Hilos that is currently connected to WhatsApp Business at the same time, for more information [click here](userdocs/getting-started/getting-started#use-an-existing-number).
</Warning>

<Steps>
  
  <Step title="Setting up your Facebook App">
    In order to get access to WhatsApp's Business API, and connect that number to Hilos, we will first need to create a Meta Developer account. Once you have one you'll be able to create an App which contains all of the relevant info to associate your number to your business.
    Before you begin, you need to have access to a personal Facebook profile. We will use this to create the App, connect it to your business and connect the number, so [**be sure to have admin access to your company Meta Business Suite account**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2169003770027706) as you'll need it for creating the app.
