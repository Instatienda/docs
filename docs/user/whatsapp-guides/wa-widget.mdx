Adding a WhatsApp button to your web page can greatly enhance communication with your audience and improve customer support. In this article, we will guide you through the simple steps of integrating a WhatsApp button and show you how to customize its appearance and behavior.

To begin, the integration of the WhatsApp button is done in the HTML code of your web page, specifically at the end of the body section. Follow these steps:

### 1. Add the following script to your HTML code:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- other stuff -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- other stuff -->

    <script type="module">
      import { CreateHilosWhatsappButton } from "https://button.hilos.io/whatsapp-button.esm.js";

      CreateHilosWhatsappButton({
        phone: "<Add your phone number here>",
        message: "Hey there! Thanks for reaching out",
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code will add a button on the lower right part of your website that will open WhatsApp on your user's device when clicked, with a pre-filled message (optional).

This is how it looks like on mobile:

This is how it looks like on desktop:

### 2. Configure the phone number

Configure the phone number that the WhatsApp button will redirect to in a new window when clicked. Replace `<Add your phone number here>` with the desired phone number.

Once the script is added and the phone number is configured, the WhatsApp button will be integrated into your web page.

### 3. Customizing the WhatsApp Button

You have the option to customize the appearance and behavior of the WhatsApp button using various parameters. Here's how you can modify its settings:

- `enabled`: Set this parameter to true to enable the button or false to disable it.
- `phone`: Specify the phone number that the WhatsApp button will contact. This parameter is required.
- `padding`: Adjust the padding around the button in pixels to increase or decrease space.
- `position`: Set the position of the button. Options include "left" or "right".
- `color`: Define the color of the WhatsApp icon using CSS color names, hexadecimal, or RGB values.
- `background`: Choose the background color of the button. Use the same color options as the color parameter.
- `message`: Enter the default message that will be sent when the button is clicked.

<Tip>
The phone number should be in the full international format, without any spaces or special characters.<br/>
**Use**: 1XXXXXXXXXX<br/>
**Don't use**: +001-(XXX)XXXXXXX
</Tip>

By customizing these parameters, you can tailor the WhatsApp button to fit the design and functionality of your web page.

Enhancing communication and improving customer support is just a step away with the integration of a WhatsApp button on your web page. Follow the simple steps and customize it to your liking. Connect with your audience effortlessly and make their experience even better.
