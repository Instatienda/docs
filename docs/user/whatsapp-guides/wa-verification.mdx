WhatsApp Green Verification Badge is a badge that appears next to a WhatsApp account's name in the app and indicates that the phone number of this account is confirmed by WhatsApp. It is a visual indicator of the authenticity of the account which helps users to identify the real WhatsApp account of a business.

## Benefits of Official WhatsApp Account

1. Increased credibility: The official account badge indicates that your business has been verified by WhatsApp, which can increase trust and credibility with customers.
2. Increased visibility: Can help your business stand out from the competition and increase visibility on WhatsApp.
3. Use your name instead of your phone number: Allows you to use your business name instead of your phone number on chats. This makes it easier for customers to find you on WhatsApp.
