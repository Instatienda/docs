title: "How to know if someone blocked me on WhatsApp?"
---

WhatsApp won't provide a way to see if a number blocked you, however your number being blocked will impact your number quality score, you can read more [here](/docs/user/whatsapp-guides/number-quality). Nevertheless the only way you might notice if someone blocked you is if the messages aren't being delivered to them, however there's no way to differentiate this from the user not receiving a message due to an internet connection interruption for instance.
