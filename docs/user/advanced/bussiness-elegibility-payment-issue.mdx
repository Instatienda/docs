title: Business elegibility payment issue
---

This error is shown when the payment method that was set up for the WhatsApp number failed and therefore the number is not able to send WhatsApp templates of any kind. To fix this go to your [Facebook Business Manager > WhatsApp Accounts](https://business.facebook.com/settings/whatsapp-business-accounts) and select the WhatsApp Account you use with Hilos, then go to configuration and payment settings, here check that the card is valid and that there are no payments due, if there are pay them and if the card is not valid update it. Once you have done this, go to Hilos and try to send a template again.
