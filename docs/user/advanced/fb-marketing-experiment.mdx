title: Facebook marketing template experiment
---

Facebook (Meta) are currently running an experiment with a few WhatsApp users which disables them from receiving Marketing Template messages. Unfortunately this experiment is non-consensual and the users that are part of the experiment are not aware of it nor can they opt out of it. If you try sending a WhatsApp message to a user that is part of the experiment, you will receive an error. The only way around this is to submit your template under the `utility` category and, if approved, send this template instead as this experiment affects only the `marketing` template category.
