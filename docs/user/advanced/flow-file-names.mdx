title: Strange file name on a flow file
---

When you upload a file to Hilos for sending in a flow, the app derives the file name from its original title. However, if the file is sourced from an external URL or integration, it undergoes a process where it is downloaded and then assigned a unique identifier known as a UUID. This UUID is an alphanumeric string, such as "f05cb730-ccc0-4d9f-b0ce-1addf5b270b8," which you may notice as the new name of your file. Currently, there is no functionality available to rename files that come from external sources through integrations.
