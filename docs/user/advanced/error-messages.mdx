This error means that the length of the variable text exceeds WhatsApp limits. It is often triggered by the header text of a template. The header is limited to 60 characters including the variable, if the text exceeds this limit you will receive this error. Please try to shorten the header text and try again.

Another common reason is that you are sending a body text that is too long, the body is limited to 1024 characters including the variable.

This error occurs when you try sending a template whose language is not compatible with the recipient's language.

Please try creating the template again with a different language.
