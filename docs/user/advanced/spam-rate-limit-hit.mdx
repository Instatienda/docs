title: Spam rate limit hit
---

WhatsApp provides this error not because of spamming as its name might infer but rather because of the messaging limit on your account. Unverified Businesses in Facebook have a limit of 250 conversations per month while verified businesses start with 1,000 conversations, Facebook then starts raising this limit according to usage, however if you try sending more conversations than your account is allowed to your template sending will stop for any unitialized conversations and the Spam rate limit hit error will appear. You can check your current limit by going to https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/phone-numbers and clicking on the gear next to the phone number you wish to know the limit for.
