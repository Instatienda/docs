title: API - How to get a list of all the flows in my account?
---

Currently there isnâ€™t a publicly accesible endpoint to do this, [you can request however a custom metabase report](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+525592257050&text=Hi!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20Hilos.) which will provide you a JSON of the flows in your account but it will be a publicly accessible URL. This might be a feature in the future but for now, you can request a custom report by contacting us and using those for obtaining the existing flows and their respective UUIDs.

If you opt for the custom report you can just make a GET request directly to the URL provided and you will get a JSON with the flows in your account.
