-  To make a text bold, you can use the `*` character before and after the text you want to make bold. For example, `*this is bold*` will be shown as **this is bold**.
- To make a text italic, you can use the `_` character before and after the text you want to make italic. For example, `_this is italic_` will be shown as *this is italic*.
- To make a text strikethrough, you can use the `~` character before and after the text you want to strikethrough. For example, `~this is strikethrough~` will be shown as ~~this is strikethrough~~.
- To make a text monospace, you can use the ``` character before and after the text you want to make monospace. For example, ```this is monospace``` will be shown as `this is monospace`.
- To make a bullet list you can use the `*` character before the text you want to make a bullet list. For example, `* this is a bullet list` will be shown as:
  - this is a bullet list
- To make a numbered list you can write a number followed by a dot `1. ` before the text you want to make a numbered list. For example, `1. this is a numbered list` will be shown as:
  1. this is a numbered list
- To format a quote you can use the `>` character before the text you want to format as a quote. For example, `> this is a quote` will be shown as:
  > this is a quote
- Inline code can be formatted using the \` character before and after the text you want to format as code. For example, \`this is inline code\` will be shown as `this is inline code`.
- Links are automatically detected and shown as links inside the app.

You can combine these styles to make your messages more expressive. For example, `*this is bold and _this is italic_*` will be shown as **this is bold and _this is italic_**.

You can also use this style formatting when creating a template so that the text inside of a template has an specific format.
