title: Initiating a Flow from the Inbox
---

To trigger a flow from the Inbox UI, start by setting up an Inbox HTTP action. This feature is enabled upon request through the support channel. You'll need:

- API Key from the account containing the flow
- The flow must be Outbound for triggering
- The UUID of the desired flow (found in the flow's URL)
- Button text for the sidebar

When creating an HTTP action, the default body includes:

```json
{
  "execute_for": "LIST",
  "contact_list": [
    {
      "phone": "{{contact.phone}}"
    }
  ],
  "has_priority": true
}
```

Ensure any required variables are added to the contact properties before executing the flow to avoid execution failures. Mention any necessary `flow_execution_variables` during creation.
