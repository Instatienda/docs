title: Adding temporary variables to a flow
---

This is an ideal scenario for using Flow Execution Variables. These variables are user-defined and can be included in the flow builder, sent via the API call body under the key `flow_execution_variables`. Note that these variables are global to a flow execution, not tied to a specific contact. If a flow execution involves multiple contacts, these variables will apply to all of them.

### Adding a Flow Execution Variable

To utilize flow execution variables, ensure your account has the feature flag enabled. Request activation through our support channel. Once activated, a new field will appear in the flow configuration. Here, you can input the desired variables within the API call. Enter the name and type, then save them.

Now, you can select these variables within the flow.

### Formatting Your API Call

The API call for flow execution variables differs slightly from a standard API call. You must include a new key `flow_execution_variables` with an object containing the expected variable keys for the flow. Remember, these variables are not contact-specific. To assign different variables to various contacts, create multiple flow executions using separate API calls.

The API call should resemble:

```
POST https://api.hilos.io/api/flow
```

```json
{
  "execute_for": "LIST",
  "contact_list": [
    {
      "phone": "+525544443333"
    }
  ],
  "flow_execution_variables": {
    "key": "value"
  },
  "has_priority": true
}
```
