# Assigning Conversations

Assigning conversations is one of the ways a flow may end. If a flow does not have an assignment step at the end, the conversation status will be `CLOSED`. If it does, the conversation status will be `NEW`, marked as unread, and the assignees will be notified.

There are two assignment steps available:

- Assign to a user
- Assign to a team

## Assigning to a User

To assign the conversation to specific users, use the **Conversation** step. This step will assign the conversation to the users selected in the step and add or append the tags selected in the step. You may select one or more users and one or more tags.

## Assigning to a Team

To assign the conversation to a team, use the **Assign to Team** step. This step will assign the conversation to the team selected in the step and add or append the tags selected in the step. For this step to work, you need to have a [team created in your account](inbox-teams) as it will use the assignation rules specified in the team's settings.
