title: Conditional step
---

Conditional steps enable you to execute a step only if a specific condition is fulfilled. This is beneficial for running steps on certain branches, such as when qualifying leads from a particular source or when a certain field is filled out.

Conditional steps combine the conditions using an AND operator, meaning all conditions must be met for the step to be run. When you use a conditional step, two branches appear on the flow editor: one for when the conditions are met (`THEN`) and one for when they are not met (`OTHERWISE`).

# Available conditions

For a condition, you can use four types of data:

- **Contact variables**: information in a contact's profile, such as their email, name, website, or custom attributes.

- **Flow variables**: variables set within the flow via [question](/user/question-step), [action](/user/action-step), [template](/user/step-types#template) or [menu](menu-step) steps.

- **Global variables**: variables set by the system, like the current date, time, day of the week, and if you are in business hours or not.

- **Execution variables**: variables passed when starting a flow.

When checking a conditional, you can look for:

- if a value is empty or not
- if a value contains another value
- if a value matches the operators `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- if a condition is met through a boolean, e.g. if the current time is in business hours.

All conditions are evaluated with an `AND` operator, meaning all conditions in the conditional must be met for the `THEN` branch to run, or the `OTHERWISE` branch will be executed.
