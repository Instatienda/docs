The Tag Step enables you to replace or append Contact or Conversation tags at any point in a Flow. This Step is useful for adding tags to Contacts or Conversations based on their responses or actions, such as in a survey Flow.

The Step Configuration is straightforward, with a single switch to choose between replacing or appending tags. Additionally, two input fields are provided to enter the tags you wish to replace or append.
