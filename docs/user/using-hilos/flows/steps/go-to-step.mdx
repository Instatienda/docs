The Go to Step is a feature that allows you to send a user to a specific step in the flow, avoiding the duplication of steps that may have existed previously or allowing the user to return to a previous menu.

A useful application of this is a FAQ bot using a menu step. After answering a question, the bot can use a Go to Step to return to the main menu and enable the user to ask a different question.
