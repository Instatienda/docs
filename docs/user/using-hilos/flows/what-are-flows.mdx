# What is a Flow?

Flows are one of Hilos' core features and help you automate your WhatsApp. They can be used to send messages, images, videos, files, validate user input and more.

The easiest way to think of Flows is as an automated conversation between you and your customer. You can send messages, ask questions, use conditions to determine what to do next, make API calls to your server, and more - all without writing code.

There are two types of Flows:

- Inbound: Triggered by a user sending a message to your WhatsApp number (text or media).
- Outbound: Triggered by manually uploading a CSV of recipients, selecting them using filters or making an API call to our server.

Flows become even more powerful when combined with Hilos' other features, like [conversation or contact tags](/docs/user/using-hilos/inbox/conversation-tab), [teams and asssignation rules](/docs/user/using-hilos/settings/teams), [templates](/docs/user/using-hilos/templates/creating-a-template), [custom fields](/docs/user/using-hilos/contacts/creating-a-contact), and more.

We make it easy to automate your conversations, so you can focus on what matters most - your customers. Let's get started creating your first Flow.
