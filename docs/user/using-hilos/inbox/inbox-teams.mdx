title: Teams and assignment rules

# What are teams?

Teams are a way to group users together. They are used to assign conversations to users based on the assignment rules you define. Useful for large teams or teams that handle different types of conversations like support, sales, etc.

Teams have the added bennefit of having rules to assign conversations in order to distribute the workload across the team.

# How to create a team

To create a team, go to the [**Settings** section](https://app.hilos.io/config/account) and click on [**Teams**](https://app.hilos.io/config/team-list). Then click on the **New team** button.

Here you can assign a name to the team and add users to it. You can also add assignment rules to the team like:

1. Round-robin: Assign conversations to users in a round-robin fashion.
2. Least-busy: Assign conversations to the user with the least amount of conversations assigned to them.
3. Use default: Always assign the conversations to the default user, useful for teams that have a manager or a supervisor which assigns conversations to the rest of the team.

<Tip>
Don't leave your users hanging, take advantage of the **Reassign if agent doesn't answer a conversation after X time?** to reassign conversations to other users if an agent doesn't answer the conversation after a certain amount of time.

**Note:** Make sure to set the conversation status to IN_PROGRESS so the conversation doesn't get assigned to another user.
