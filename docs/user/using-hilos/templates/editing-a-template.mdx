# Editing an approved or rejected template

<Note>
You can only use approved templates within Inbox/Flows/Broadcasts. If you cannot find your template when using any of them, it's possible that the template hasn't yet been approved.
</Note>

WhatsApp templates that have been approved or rejected cannot be modified. If you need to make changes to a template, you can choose to duplicate the template using the "Duplicate" button found on the menu to the right of the template. This will create a new template with the same content as the original one, ready for you to make the necessary changes.
