Our native chatGPT integration can help your team to communicate more effectively with your customers. It will provide suggestions for answers to an specific question, based on the context of the conversation. This will help your team to provide faster and more accurate responses to your customers. To set it up go to Integrations > External apps and click on Settings on the ChatGPT card.

To set up ChatGPT you'll need an OpenAPI key, once you hace one paste the token on the first field. The next field is the system prompt wich is a text that will be used as the initial prompt for the AI model and allows you to customize the way the AI will respond to the user, try to be as specific as possible and provide the most information about your company/product for it to be accurrate on its suggestions. 

The last field is the temperature which indicate the creativity of the AI, the higher the temperature the more creative the AI will be, but it will also be less accurate. We recommend to start with a temperature of 0.5 and adjust it as needed. Technical questions may require a lower temperature, while more creative questions may require a higher temperature.

You may also add URLs to the web crawler section which will serve the AI as a source of information to provide more accurate answers, you may add for example the url of your company's website or your documentation.

Once you are happy with the settings click on Save and you are ready to go!
