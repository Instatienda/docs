<Info>
  If you've previously removed a team member from your team and invite them again but the invite doesn't arrive, then the user might be deactivated. If that is the case be sure to [contact support](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+525592257050&text=Hi!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20Hilos.).

# Setting channels and permissions

Managing permissions allows you to fine-tune the level of access and control each agent has. This can ensure smoother operations while also maintaining the right level of security and oversight over activities within the platform.

On the permissions page, you're able to specify whether an agent has the ability to:

-  Update account settings: Provides agents with the authority to modify account-related details and preferences.
-  Start or update their Hilos Subscription: Determines whether agents can activate or revise their Hilos subscription details.
-  Create, update, or delete flows: Manages the agent's ability to interact with, modify, or remove established chatbot/inbound/outbound flows.
-  View the flows section: Controls an agent's permission to see the flow elements on the platform.
-  Send broadcasts: Gives agents the power to send massive messages using approved WhatsApp templates.
-  View the broadcast section: Manages the agent's access to the section where broadcasts are initiated.
-  View the inbox section: Allows or restricts an agent's ability to view incoming messages via the inbox.
-  Create or delete WhatsApp Templates: Dictates whether an agent can create or remove prewritten message templates.

In addition to these, you can also activate or deactivate the WhatsApp numbers that an agent has access to. This means you can decide which agent can modify the corresponding flows, templates, visualize the messages of it on the inbox, or send broadcasts, given that they have the necessary permissions to do so.
