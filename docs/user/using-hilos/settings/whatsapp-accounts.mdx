## Adding WhatsApp Accounts

As your team grows, you may want to add more WhatsApp accounts to your Hilos account. This is useful for the following reasons:

-  **Keeping things separate:** If your company uses the same number for support and promotional messages, conversations can become cluttered. By adding new numbers, each team can have its own dedicated number.
-  **Improving number quality:** When sending large campaigns, Facebook may flag the number as spam based on response rate and the number of messages marked as spam by users. By using separate numbers, you can prevent the quality and conversation limits of your main channel from being affected. [Read more about quality here]().
-  **Exploring new ideas:** If you want to explore a new business idea but want to use existing agents in your account, adding a new account ensures that you don't have to pay for additional agents you already have.

Now, simply follow the connection guide, which you can find [here](/userdocs/getting-started/connect-a-new-number). If you already have a phone number connected to Hilos, you can skip step 1 of the guide and use the existing app instead.

### Removing/Disabling WhatsApp Accounts

To disable a WhatsApp channel, go to [Settings > WhatsApp accounts](https://app.hilos.io/config/channel) and click on the desired channel.

Click on the "Deactivate channel" button. This will disable the channel for use but keep all previous information on the platform. Please note that disabling the number on Hilos only deactivates it within Hilos, but the number remains active on Meta's WhatsApp Manager. To completely remove a WhatsApp number, remove it from the WhatsApp Manager on Meta Business.
