Organizing your agents into teams on Hilos.io can supercharge your efficiency when it comes to managing your WhatsApp conversation flows. Teams can reflect different areas within your organization, for instance, customer support, sales, or other specific business units. 

To form a team, navigate to [Settings > Teams](https://app.hilos.io/config/team-list). Here you can create or delete a team as well as the users that form it and the assignation rules they follow.

Once a team is well-established, they can greatly benefit from the 'Assign Team' step within a flow. This gives you the power to automatically assign conversations to team members based on one of the following methods:

-  **Round Robin**: In this setup, each new conversation is assigned to the next agent in line according to a predefined order, enabling an even distribution of workload.

-  **Least Load**: Preferential assignment of new conversations to the agent with the fewest open conversations. This method ensures the workload is distributed based on the agents' current commitments.

It also allows you to set a time after which it will automatically reassign to the next user in case there hasn't been a response from the agent.

Alternatively, you also have the option to assign conversations directly to a specific agent within a team. This can be useful when there's a need for an expert's touch or specific role allocation within a conversation.

By flexibly using teams and smart assignment strategies, you can optimize your company's response time, enhance agent productivity, and ultimately, improve customer satisfaction levels.
