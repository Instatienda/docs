Give your Broadcast a name, and select a template from one of your approved templates. If you have not yet created a template, you can learn how to do so [here](/docs/user/using-hilos/templates/creating-a-template).

Upload a CSV containing the list of recipients you want to send your broadcast to. And the variables you want to use in your template.

Your CSV be formatted like this:

| | A | B | C | D | E | F | G |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | +525533424673 | | | | | | |
| 2 | +525533424673 | | | | | | |
| 3 | +525533424673 | | | | | | |

The first column should contain the phone numbers of the recipients. The rest of the columns should contain the variables you want to use in your template. **Please note the single quote before the phone numbers, this is to prevent excel from treating the phone number as a formula.**

<Tip>
You may download a template CSV by clicking on `Download here a .csv template to see to how this .csv file should be formatted.` customize it and upload it to the broadcast.
