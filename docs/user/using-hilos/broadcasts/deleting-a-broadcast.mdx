Deleting a broadcast is a permanent action. Once you delete a broadcast, it cannot be recovered. If a broadcast is deleted but messages have been sent to recipients, those messages will still be delivered.

To delete a broadcast click on the Delete button in the broadcast list next to the broadcast you want to delete.
