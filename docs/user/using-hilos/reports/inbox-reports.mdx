# Hilos Reports

Hilos provides insightful reports to understand your team's conversations in the Inbox. Here is a brief summary of how to use hilos so that these reports are as engaging and useful as possible:

* Use **Conversation Tags**: These are utilized to classify individual conversations and later measure metrics such as the number of Support versus Sales conversations. 
* **Close conversations** (either manually or automatically) to ensure conversations do not remain open for longer than necessary.
* Choose the correct report based on your requirement: whether you want to look at a general summary, delve into team performance (reports by agent), analyze conversation reasons (reports by tag), or access raw data (detail).

In the left nav bar, there are four types of reports:
