Facebook Business Verification is an optional process that is necessary if you want to increase the outbound conversations limits within the WhatsApp Business API. If not completed, you may only have up to 250 conversations per day, and you may not apply for the verification badge on your WhatsApp profile. <img src="https://hilos-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/documentation/userdocs/getting-started/next-steps/business-verification/img1.png" alt="WhatsApp Business Verification Tick" width="30" />

To complete the verification process, you will need the following:

- A domain name that you own and a website which contains your legal name (corporate entity), as well as your commercial name (name you want to use on WhatsApp).
- An email address with that domain name.
- A document that validates the legal name which can be either:
  - Certificate of incorporation or formation
  - Business license
  - Tax or VAT registration certificate
- Address and phone number verification which could be done with:
  - Utility bill
  - Bank statement
  - Business license

<Note>
  The phone number used to make the Business Verification doesn't have to be the
  same as your WhatsApp Business phone number, but it must be a phone number
  that you own.
