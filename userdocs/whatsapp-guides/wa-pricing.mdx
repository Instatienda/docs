When dealing with the WhatsApp API the pricing depends on the country and wether a conversation was initiated by the user or the business and the type of message sent.

For business initiated conversation there are 3 possible categories of messages:

1. Utility conversations - Facilitate a specific, agreed-upon request or transaction or update to a customer about an ongoing transaction, including post-purchase notifications and recurring billing statements
2. Authentication conversations - Enable businesses to authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges)
3. Marketing conversations - Include promotions or offers, informational updates, or invitations for customers to respond / take action. Any conversation that does not qualify as utility or authentication is a marketing conversation.

All user initiated conversations are considered **Service conversations** which help users to get support from businesses.

Conversation initiated from Facebook ads or Facebook pages call to actions are free of charge and have a different time window of 72hrs instead of the regular 24hrs.

<Warning>
From June 1st onwards only user (service) conversations will be counted towards the free 1,000 monthly conversations limit, business initiated conversations will no longer be within this limit.
</Warning>

If a template is sent within a [24h conversation window](/user/24h-conversation-window) that corresponds to the same category that the one that initiated a conversation no additional charges will be made, however if you send a different category template or a template outside of the 24h window you will be charged for the template message.

For example, if you initiate a conversation with a Marketing template and during the conversation you send a Utility template, then 2 charges will be made for the conversation even if they land within the same [24h window](/user/24h-conversation-window). Same for when the user initiates the conversation, if the user sends a message then the conversation is categorized as Service conversation, but if you send a template message then you will be charged for the template message depending on the category.

<Warning>
Be sure to have a [payment method configured on your WhatsApp account](/user/facebook-payment-method) so your WhatsApp number is able to send messages uninterruptedly.
</Warning>
