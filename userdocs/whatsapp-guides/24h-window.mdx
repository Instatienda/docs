The WhatsApp Business API is a powerful tool that allows businesses to communicate with their customers at scale. However, there are some important limitations that businesses should be aware of. One of these limitations is the 24-hour conversation window.

The 24-hour conversation window is a time frame during which businesses can communicate with customers via WhatsApp after the customer has initiated a conversation with them. During this 24-hour window, businesses can send messages to the customer, including text, images, and videos, without any restrictions.

However, once the 24-hour window has passed, businesses can no longer send proactive messages to the customer. Instead they may only initiate conversations with one of their approved templates.

There are several reasons for the 24-hour conversation window. One of the main reasons is to protect users' privacy and prevent spam. By limiting the time frame during which businesses can send messages, WhatsApp ensures that users do not receive unwanted or irrelevant messages outside of their control.

Another reason for the 24-hour window is to encourage businesses to provide timely and relevant information to their customers. By providing customers with the information they need in a timely manner, businesses can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

To comply with the 24-hour conversation window, businesses need to be vigilant and responsive to customer queries. They should prioritize responding to customer queries during the 24-hour window to maximize the opportunity to engage with customers and provide them with the information they need. Additionally, businesses can use chatbots to automate responses and provide 24/7 support to customers.

By understanding the limitations and opportunities of the 24-hour window, businesses can create effective messaging strategies that maximize engagement and improve customer satisfaction.
