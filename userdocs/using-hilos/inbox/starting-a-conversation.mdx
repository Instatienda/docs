# Starting a conversation

To start a conversation with a contact go to your [Inbox](https://app.hilos.io/inbox/) and click on the plus sign at the top of the page.

<Tip>
You can search using a phone number, if a contact with the number does not exist you can still initiate a conversation by typing the number and clicking on **Start conversation**.

Select the contact you wish from the sidebar that appeared or add a number you wish to contact. If you wish to add more team members to the conversation you can do so there as well.

Then click on **Start conversation**.

You'll see the conversation appear on the Inbox and you'll need to select one of your [templates](/user/create-a-template) to send the first message.
