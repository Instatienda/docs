## Adding or Removing Team Members

To add or remove team members to your account, go to https://app.hilos.io/config/account-members. Here, you can invite new team members to join your account or remove existing team members.

<Info>
  If you've previously removed a team member from your team and invite them again but the invite doesn't arrive, then the user might be deactivated. If that is the case be sure to [contact support](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+525592257050&text=Hi!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20Hilos.).
