# Creating a template

On this guide you'll learn what is a template, why do you need one and how you can create your own. Lets get into it!

The first thing we need to do is go to our [template list](https://app.hilos.io/template).

  <figcaption>
    Give your template a name, a category and select the language it will be
    written in.

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** Use a number surrounded by _two pairs of curly braces_ to indicate the use of a variable. Like this: **{{1}}** or **{{2}}**, they'll be replaced by text later on.
</Tip>

  <figcaption>
    Now provide the URL of the photo/video for the header if needed and do a bit
    of testing with your variables. Once you're happy click Submit.

<Warning>
**Warning:** The URL you add here **IS NOT** attached to the template, it's only used for testing purposes, later when using this template you'll need to provide the URL of the media again.
</Warning>

  <figcaption>
    Your template will now be sent for approval, once it's ready to be used
    you'll se its status change from **Pending** to **Approved**.

<Warning>
Please bear in mind that Hilos doesn't have any control over the approval process or its completion time, this is an internal WhatsApp process. and can take a while to complete. Usually it takes a few minutes for Meta to approve a template, but the official guideline is that it may take up to 2 business days.

Make sure to create them ahead of time!
</Warning>
