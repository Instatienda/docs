# Menu Steps

Menu steps allow you to create several branches inside the editor. Contacts can access these branches via a menu displayed as buttons, a list button, numbers, or emojis.

Creating a menu step is similar to creating a single-option question step, with the main difference being that a branch is created inside the editor for each option.

As with the Single option question step you may use buttons, a list button, numbers, or emojis to display the menu options.

It's worth remembering that buttons have a limit of 3 options with list having up to 10 options, both buttons and list have a limit of 20 characters per option. Learn more about question steps [here](question-step)

You can combine the menu step with the [Go to step](go-to-step) feature to allow users to return to the main menu after going through a branch.
