# Delay Step

The delay step is used to postpone the execution of the next step in the workflow. It is helpful when you want to wait a certain amount of time before executing the next step. For example, you may want to wait for a minute before sending the next message to the user, to give the impression that the bot is typing.

The delay step can wait for minutes, hours, or days. However, if the delay is longer than 24 hours, the next step must be a Template step as the [24h conversation window defined by WhatsApp](24h-conversation-window) might have expired by then.
