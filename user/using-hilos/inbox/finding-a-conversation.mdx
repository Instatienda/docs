Searching for a conversation on your Inbox is easier than ever. You can find a conversation using the search bar at the top of your Inbox by looking up the name of the person you're talking to.

## Filtering conversations

You can also filter conversations by using the filters on the right side of the search bar. You can filter conversations by:

- Status
- Assignee
- Conversations assigned to you
- Contact tags
- Conversation tags
- Unread
- Wether the conversation is archived or not
- Time since last message
- If the contact was the last to reply
- If the last message was read by the contact or not

<Note>
If the contact turned off the read receipts, the conversation will be marked as unread even if the contact read the message.
