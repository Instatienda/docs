To manage your subscription, go to https://app.hilos.io/config/subscription. Here, you can update your subscription plan, add extra seats, and view your billing history.

The first time you set up your subscription, you'll need to add a payment method through Stripe. Hilos does not store any payment information on its servers for security reasons.

## Pricing

If you're not sure which subscription plan to choose, you can check our pricing page at https://hilos.io/pricing. Our pricing is based on the number of seats (team members), the number of contacts (unique phone numbers contacted montly) and number of WhatsApp lines (unique WhatsApp numbers used to send messages).

## Adding Extra Seats or Conversations

If you need to add extra seats or conversations to your plan, these will be tallied and charged on your next monthly invoice. You can add these by going to https://app.hilos.io/config/subscription and updating your subscription plan.

## Downloading Invoices

If you need to download your invoices, you can do so by going to https://app.hilos.io/config/invoices. Here, you can view and download your past invoices in PDF format.

And that's it! With these steps, you should be able to manage your Hilos subscription and keep your conversations running smoothly. If you have any questions or need additional support, don't hesitate to contact our team for assistance.
