Inbox can be customized to fit your team's needs. To do so go to [settings > Inbox config](https://app.hilos.io/config/account/inbox). Here, you can customize the following settings:

- Adding the agent's name before each message
- Whether agents can see all conversations or only the ones assigned to them
- Automatically closing conversations after a set number of hours
- Automatically archiving conversations when marked as closed
- Sending a customer satisfaction question after the conversation
