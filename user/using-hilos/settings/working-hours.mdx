<Warning>
  If you have a Chatbot Flow on your account this setting will not work, create a working hours conditional inside the Chatbot flow. [Learn how]().
</Warning>

To set up your working hours and after-hours message, go to [Hilos > Settings > Working Hours](https://app.hilos.io/config/account/hours). Here, you can specify your business hours and set up an automatic message for customers who try to contact you outside of those hours.
