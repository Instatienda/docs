WhatsApp has become one of the most popular messaging platforms in the world, transitioning from end-to-end user communications to enabling businesses to connect and interact with their customers. In recent years, WhatsApp has launched two separate business-oriented services: WhatsApp Business App and WhatsApp Business API. While both services are designed for businesses to communicate with customers, they have different features, use cases, and requirements.

## WhatsApp Business App

WhatsApp Business App is a free-to-use mobile app designed for small businesses to communicate with their customers on a personal level. The app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store and installed on a mobile phone. Once the app is installed, businesses can set up a business profile that includes a description, email address, website, business hours, and location.

The WhatsApp Business App enables businesses to send and receive messages, images, and documents to their customers. Businesses can also create and send automated messages such as welcome messages, absence messages, and quick replies. Additionally, businesses can create and send out catalogs of their products or services, which customers can browse and order from directly within the app.

This service is perfect for small businesses that want to communicate with their customers on a personal level. However, the app is limited to one device and can only be used by one person at a time. Businesses that need to use the app on multiple devices will not be able to do so, that's why WhatsApp Business API was created.

WhatsApp Business App lacks the massive messaging function, although there are a few apps that promise to automate this messaging process for you but Facebook does not approve them and may result in your number being banned. This restriction is one of the reasons why WhatsApp Business API was created.

## WhatsApp Business API

WhatsApp Business API, on the other hand, is a paid service designed for larger businesses to communicate with customers at scale. The API allows businesses to integrate WhatsApp into their existing customer relationship management (CRM) software and automate conversations using chatbots. The API can only be accessed through third-party service providers, which act as intermediaries between businesses and WhatsApp.

One of the key differences between business app and business API is the lack of a user interface. The WhatsApp Business API does not have an app or web interface, this is why businesses must integrate the API into their existing CRM software or use an app like Hilos to send and automate messaging.

One of the key advantages of using WhatsApp Business API is that it allows businesses to send highly targeted and personalized messages to their customers at scale. It also allows to send more marketing and automated messages to customers than the WhatsApp Business App.

In summary, while both WhatsApp Business App and WhatsApp Business API are designed for businesses to communicate with their customers on the platform, they have different features, use cases, and requirements. WhatsApp Business App is a free-to-use mobile app designed for small businesses to communicate with their customers on a personal level. WhatsApp Business API is a paid service designed for larger businesses to communicate with customers at scale, offering the ability to integrate WhatsApp into existing CRM software and automate conversations using chatbots.
