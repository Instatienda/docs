Now that you've successfully set up your account and connected your number to Hilos, it's time to dive into the exciting world of messaging. In this article, we'll walk you through the simple process of sending your first message on the platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or choose a template">
    Navigate to the [Templates](https://app.hilos.io/template) section. You can create a custom template for starting conversations or opt for the initial templates provided by Facebook. Design your templates with an engaging and creative flair that represents your brand.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a Conversation in the Inbox">
    Now it's time to head to the [Inbox](https://app.hilos.io/inbox). This is where you'll start your quick conversation with your contact. Click the **+** button on the top right of the Inbox conversation list to open a new conversation. A sidebar will appear, allowing you to search for your contact or enter the phone number you'd like to message.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Template to Open the Conversation">
    With the conversation open, click the "select a template to open the conversation" button at the bottom of the screen. Choose either a prefilled template or one of the default templates provided by Facebook. If the template contains variables, you'll be prompted to fill in the variable values.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for a reply">
    Wait for a Reply and Engage in a 24-Hour Conversation Window
    Once the template has been sent, patiently wait for your contact to reply. Upon receiving their response, a 24-hour conversation window will open, allowing you to send messages through the Inbox just like you would on WhatsApp Web.
